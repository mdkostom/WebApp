Web Applications - Mark K

1) As a user, I want to be able to see a login screen when I first access the application so that I can enter my credentials and access the system.

2) As a user, I want to be able to enter my username and password on the login screen so that I can authenticate myself and access my account.

3) As a user, I want to be able to see a message on the login screen if I enter incorrect credentials so that I can correct them and try again.

4) As a user, I want to be able to reset my password using a link on the login screen if I forget my password so that I can regain access to my account.

5) As a user, I want to be able to see a checkbox on the login screen that allows me to remember my username and password so that I don't have to enter them every time I access the system.
